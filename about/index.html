            <div id="aboutTitle">Hi! I'm Bob Ross!</div>
            Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.
            I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Just beat the devil out of it. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen.
            Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Just make little strokes like that. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.
            You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. With practice comes confidence. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is.
            Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun.
            Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. You can get away with a lot. You need the dark in order to show the light. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.
            Even the worst thing we can do here is good. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Learn when to stop. Don't fight it, use what happens. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.
